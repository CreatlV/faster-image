A performant way to render images in React Native with a focus on speed and memory usage. Powered by [Nuke](https://github.com/kean/nuke), the smallest and most performant image loading library for iOS and macOS and [Coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil) on Android.

> The framework is lean and compiles in under 2 secondsÂ¹. Nuke has an automated test suite 2x the size of the codebase itself, ensuring excellent reliability. Every feature is carefully designed and optimized for performance.

> Coil performs a number of optimizations including memory and disk caching, downsampling the image in memory, automatically pausing/cancelling requests, and more.

## Features
- [x] Supports visionOS
- [x] Fast image loading
- [x] Memory and disk caching
- [x] Placeholder support:
  - [x] [blurhash](https://github.com/woltapp/blurhash)
  - [x] [thumbhash](https://github.com/evanw/thumbhash) (iOS)
  - [x] Base64 encoded image
- [x] Animated transition
- [x] Failure image
- [x] Typescript support
- [x] Written in Swift

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @candlefinance/faster-image
```

## Usage

```js
import { FasterImageView } from '@candlefinance/faster-image';

FasterImageView
  onError={(event) => console.warn(event.nativeEvent.error)}
  style={styles.image}
  onSuccess={(event) => {
    console.log(event.nativeEvent);
  }}
  source={{
    transitionDuration: 0.3,
    borderRadius: 50,
    cachePolicy: 'discWithCacheControl',
    showActivityIndicator: true,
    thumbhash: 'k0oGLQaSVsJ0BVhn2oq2Z5SQUQcZ',
