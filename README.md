A performant way to render images in React Native (**iOS only**) with a focus on speed and memory usage. Powered by [Nuke](https://github.com/kean/nuke), the smallest and most performant image loading library for iOS and macOS.

> The framework is lean and compiles in under 2 secondsÂ¹. Nuke has an automated test suite 2x the size of the codebase itself, ensuring excellent reliability. Every feature is carefully designed and optimized for performance.

## Features

- [x] Fast image loading
- [x] Memory and disk caching
- [x] Placeholder support: base64, blurhash, thumbhash and UIActivityIndicatorView
- [x] Animated transition
- [x] Typescript support
- [x] Written in Swift

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @candlefinance/faster-image
```

## Usage

```js
import { FasterImageView } from '@candlefinance/faster-image';

<FasterImageView
  onError={(event) => console.warn(event.nativeEvent.error)}
  style={{ width: 400, height: 300 }}
  resizeMode="contain"
  thumbhash="k0oGLQaSVsJ0BVhn2oq2Z5SQUQcZ"
  cachePolicy="discNoCacheControl"
  transitionDuration={0.3}
  url="https://picsum.photos/seed/3240/4000/3000"
/>;
```
